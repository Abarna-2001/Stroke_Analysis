    "# STROKE DATA ANALYTICS\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the main entry point for the *Stroke Data Analytics* project. It launches a user-friendly Tkinter GUI that lets clinicians explore a stroke dataset through 12 predefined queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overview\n",
    "The project consists of four files:\n",
    "- **dataset_module.py**: Loads the stroke dataset (`data.csv`) into a nested dictionary.\n",
    "- **query_module.py**: Defines 12 queries to analyze the dataset (e.g., average age of smokers with stroke) and saves results to CSV.\n",
    "- **ui_module.py**: Creates a Tkinter GUI with a dropdown for selecting queries, a text area for results, and buttons for saving to CSV or exiting.\n",
    "- **main.ipynb** (this file): Runs the GUI by calling `ui_module.run_user_interface`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (`data.csv`) contains patient data with 22 features, like Age, Hypertension, and Stroke Occurrence. The GUI makes it easy for clinicians to run queries and save results."

    "### 2. Setup Instructions\n",
    "This section guides users on preparing their environment to run the notebook. It lists requirements (Python, Tkinter, file placement) and explains how to handle common setup issues, like file paths or permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, let’s get everything set up:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can check by running `python3 --version` in your terminal.\n",
    "2. **Tkinter**: This is usually included with Python. On Linux, you might need to install it with `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`.\n",
    "3. **Dataset file**: Place `data.csv` in the same folder as this notebook. If it’s elsewhere, update the `data_file` path in the code below.\n",
    "4. **Project files**: Ensure these Python files are in the same folder as this notebook:\n",
    "   - `dataset_module.py`\n",
    "   - `query_module.py`\n",
    "   - `ui_module.py`\n",
    "5. **Write permissions**: For saving CSVs, the current folder needs write access. On Linux, run `chmod u+w .` in your terminal if you see permission errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re using a Jupyter environment like VS Code or Jupyter Notebook, you’re good to go! These support Tkinter’s GUI popups."

    "1. Open this notebook in a Jupyter environment that supports GUI popups (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebook).\n",
    "2. Run the code cell below to launch the GUI.\n",
    "3. In the GUI:\n",
    "   - Select a query from the dropdown (e.g., \"1. Average, modal, and median age...\").\n",
    "   - For Query 10, enter a feature name (e.g., \"Age\").\n",
    "   - Click \"Run Query\" to see results.\n",
    "   - Click \"Save to CSV\" to save results to a file.\n",
    "   - Click \"Exit\" to close the GUI.\n",
